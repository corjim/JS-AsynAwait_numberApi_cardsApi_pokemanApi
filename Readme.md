# JavaScript Asyn Await

### Asynchronous Code

- Three APIs were explored using the asynchronous callbacks and asyncAwait method.

- Random numbers were chosen to get the meaning or text using axios request.

- With the same AJAX method, decks of cards were drawn and display at random over repetive API calls and the pattern of how this await method works inside an async function.

- Lastly the same method was used to explore and display the names and urls of pokeman.
